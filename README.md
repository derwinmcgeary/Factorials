# Factorials

This is a repo demonstrating recursive calculation of factorials.

## Build

`git clone https://github.com/derwinmcgeary/Factorials.git`

`cd Factorials`

`javac factorial.java`

That will get you the interactive version. To see the non-interactive version (factorials up to 20), check out the "feature" branch with

`git checkout feature`

then `javac factorial.java`

## Usage

`java factorial`

Then, in the interactive version, enter positive integers and press enter. In the non-interactive version, a table will appear, as if written by an unseen hand.
