# Factorials

This is a repo demonstrating recursive calculation of factorials.

## Build

`git clone https://github.com/derwinmcgeary/Factorials.git`

`javac factorial.java`

To see the other version (factorials up to 20), do

`git checkout feature`

then `javac factorial.java`

## Use

`java factorial`

Then, in the interactive version, enter positive integers and press enter. In the non-interactive version, a table will appear, as if written by an unseen hand.
